This is an exercise in working TDD as minute steps to build up a simple system.

It is based on the the Unbounded Stack example from chapter 2 of the book "Test-Driven Development in Microsoft .NET"

It implements an Unbounded Stack in small steps by picking tests from the test list and driving them out via rigorous TDD.

At the end of the process, the code is refactored to be more Ruby-ish in style and utility.

NOTE: There is also a branch called 'ugly_code' which shows a working version of the Unbounded Stack written in very poor code. It is useful as an exercise in refactoring. In other words, take the ugly code and in small steps, refactor it to a much cleaner implementation, keeping the tests passing along the way.
